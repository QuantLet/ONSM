Description: 'An integration of social media characteristics into an econometric framework requires modeling a high dimensional dynamic network with dimensions of parameter $\Theta$ typically much larger than the number of observations. To cope with this problem we impose two structural assumptions onto the singular value decomposition of $\Theta = U D V^{\top}$. Firstly, the matrix with probabilities of connections between the nodes of a network has a rank much lower than the number of nodes. Therefore, there is limited amount of non-zero elements on the diagonal of $D$ and the whole operator admits a lower dimensional factorisation. Secondly, in observed social networks only a small portion of users are highly-affecting, leading to a sparsity regularization imposed on singular vectors $V.$
